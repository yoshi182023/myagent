# Implementation Progress



## 🌟 Plan Overview

### Phase 1: seed_knowledge.py (Knowledge Base Initialization)

**Files:**
- `scripts/seed_knowledge.py` (NEW)

**Workflow:**
```
Scan knowledge_base/
    ↓
GET /api/v1/workspace/{slug} query documents already in workspace (documents[].title)
    ↓
Compare: local filename vs existing title
    ↓
New files → POST /api/v1/document/upload (with addToWorkspaces=<slug>, one call completes
          "upload" + "embed into workspace")
Existing files → skip
    ↓
Print summary
```

**Run:**
```bash
python -m scripts.seed_knowledge
```

**Dependencies (.env already exists, no new additions needed):**
```
ANYTHINGLLM_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001
ANYTHINGLLM_API_KEY=<real key>
ANYTHINGLLM_WORKSPACE=apprentice-kb
```

API paths have been verified on locally running AnythingLLM container using its built-in Swagger (`/api/docs/`), not guesses. Complete pseudocode in `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.

### Phase 2: seed_database.py (One-click initialization, optional)

**Files:**
- `scripts/seed_database.py` (NEW)

**One-click flow:**
```bash
python -m scripts.seed_database
```

Execution:
1. Run DB migration (`flask db upgrade`)
2. Call `seed_knowledge.py` to upload knowledge base

## ✅ Workflow

- [ ] Create `scripts/seed_knowledge.py`
- [ ] Run with real AnythingLLM container + real API key to verify documents actually appear in workspace (not just in global document library)
- [ ] Run a second time to verify existing files are skipped
- [ ] Create `scripts/seed_database.py` (optional, thin wrapper)
