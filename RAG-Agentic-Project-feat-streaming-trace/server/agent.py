"""The bounded agent loop — the core of the project.

One iteration of the loop looks like this:

    1. Ask the LLM what to do next            (generate() via record_step)
    2. If it answered in plain text  -> done, that's the final answer
    3. If it asked for a tool        -> validate args, run the tool
    4. Append the tool result to the message history and go to 1

Guardrails wrapped around that loop (all required by the project brief):

    - MAX_AGENT_STEPS hard cap        -> run fails instead of looping forever
    - argument validation, 1 retry    -> malformed tool call gets one chance
    - LoopGuard fingerprinting        -> identical repeated calls get blocked
    - requires_confirmation tools     -> loop PAUSES (needs_confirmation) and
                                         only resumes after the user approves
    - stop/disconnect checks          -> user can cancel a run mid-flight

Every LLM call and tool call is persisted as a RunStep via record_step(), so
the whole run is visible in the UI trace panel and the Audit tab.

    "# Tools\n"
    "You have access to the registered tools: `search_knowledge` and `list_tickets`. Call them when needed; do not invent tools. Execute exactly one tool call per turn with zero preamble or conversational filler.\n\n"

    "2. Once `search_knowledge` returns the policy context or answers, synthesize the final answer formatted with the preset draft structure.\n\n"
    "# Constraints\n"
    "- At most one clarifying question, and only if crucial details are genuinely missing. Never ask a second round of questions.\n"
