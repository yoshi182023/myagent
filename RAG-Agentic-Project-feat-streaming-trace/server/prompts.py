"""All prompt templates in one place, so wording can be tuned without touching
logic code. (The main agent SYSTEM_PROMPT lives in agent.py next to the loop.)

Who uses what:
  URGENCY_*                        -> urgency.py (ticket priority classification)
  TRIAGE_USER_PROMPT               -> routes.triage_ticket_endpoint (the goal
                                      handed to the agent loop for a ticket)
  PIP_CLASSIFICATION_PROMPT        -> routes.pip_chat step 0.5 (does this chat
                                      message need a knowledge-base search?)
  PIP_SYSTEM_PROMPT (+ suffix)     -> routes.pip_chat (the tool-less chat widget)

Templates are .format()-ed, so literal braces in output examples must be
doubled ({{ }}).
